# Healthcare CRM Project

## Problem Statement 
Hospitals and clinics often struggle with managing patient appointments, medical records, and follow-ups efficiently. Patients face long waiting times, missed appointments, and difficulty accessing their reports. Doctors also waste time handling paperwork instead of focusing on patient care.

## Project Overview  
We propose building a Healthcare CRM Solution that manages patient data, appointments, and communication in a centralized system.
Patients can book, reschedule, or cancel appointments online.
Doctors can access medical history quickly and update prescriptions digitally.
Automated reminders (SMS/Email) will reduce missed appointments.
Analytics dashboards will help hospital admins track patient inflow, doctor workload, and revenue.

## Objectives  
Improve efficiency – Reduce waiting time and manual scheduling.
Automate tasks – Appointment booking, reminders, and billing.
Ensure data accuracy – Maintain digital medical history securely.
Enhance patient experience – Easy access to reports and faster consultations.
Better reporting – Hospital management can make informed decisions with real-time data.
