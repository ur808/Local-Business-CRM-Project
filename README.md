# 🌟 Local Business CRM

## 🧩 Problem Statement

People often struggle to find reliable and verified local service providers such as plumbers, electricians, and cleaners. Most of the time, customers face delays, lack of trust, and no proper tracking of service requests. Service providers also face challenges in managing bookings, payments, and communication efficiently.

## 💡 Project Overview

We propose a **Local Business Service CRM** that connects customers with trusted service providers in their area.

* Customers can request services online (plumbing, electrician, cleaning, etc.).
* Service providers receive job notifications and can accept or reject them.
* Automated reminders for scheduled services (e.g., AC maintenance every 6 months).
* Ratings & feedback system to improve service quality.
* Admin (agency/company) can track overall requests, completed jobs, and revenue.

## 🎯 Objectives

* **Improve efficiency** – Quick and hassle-free service booking for customers.
* **Automate tasks** – Service reminders, job assignments, and payment follow-ups.
* **Ensure data accuracy** – Verified service provider details and customer history.
* **Enhance user experience** – Trusted providers, easy booking, and faster response.
* **Better reporting** – Insights into demand, service quality, and provider performance.
