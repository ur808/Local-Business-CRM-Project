# Local Business Service CRM Project

## Problem Statement  
People often struggle to find reliable and verified local service providers like plumbers, electricians, and cleaners. Most of the time, there are delays, lack of trust, and no proper tracking of service requests. Service providers also face issues in managing bookings, payments, and customer communication.  

## Project Overview  
We propose a **Local Business Service CRM** that connects customers with trusted service providers in their area.  

- Customers can request services online (plumbing, electrician, cleaning, etc.).  
- Service providers receive job notifications and can accept/reject them.  
- Automated reminders for scheduled services (e.g., AC maintenance every 6 months).  
- Ratings & feedback system to improve service quality.  
- Admin (agency/company) can track overall requests, completed jobs, and revenue.  

## Objectives  
- **Improve efficiency** â€“ Quick and hassle-free service booking for customers.  
- **Automate tasks** â€“ Service reminders, job assignments, and payment follow-ups.  
- **Ensure data accuracy** â€“ Verified service provider details and customer history.  
- **Enhance user experience** â€“ Trusted providers, easy booking, and faster response.  
- **Better reporting** â€“ Insights into demand, service quality, and provider performance.
